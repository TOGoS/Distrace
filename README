Distrace (Distance + Trace)

A path tracer for rendering extremely large scenes using an octree.

The tracing-optimized octree is compiled and stored on disk and memory-mapped.
This structure is specific to the architecture and version of the software, as it's
native structures in memory.  Instead of pointers, offsets into the file are used.
Very large scenes may therefore require a 64-bit processor.

Candidate for 'pointer' format:
<16-bit size> <48-bit address, ignoring lowest 4 bits>

All structures will be 128-bit aligned; therefore we can ignore the
lowest 4 bits of object addresses and they can be used for flags, and
the address can be gleaned just by ANDing with 0x0000FFFFFFFFFFF0.

128 bits = 16 bytes = 4 bits of address
